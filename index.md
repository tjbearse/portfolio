<h1>Hobby Projects</h1>

I'm always cooking up multiple project for fun.
I've got a diverse set of interests and I enjoy variety in approaches and disciplines.
Often I find something in the world that sticks with me and I like to bring these ideas together into experiments, learning exercises, and tools for my own use.
In that creative exercise I come to learn a lot about my subject and the medium in which I explore it.

Here is a sample of my work that has a strong software component.
