An art-heavy puzzle game, made as a game-a-week exercise. The concept was insprired by social engineering. The implementation of the primary mechanic involves heavy use of sorting layers and masking to create layered x-ray like visual effects. These systems had to be replicated in the click interactions. The game also features a simple dialog tree implementation.

Art assets by me.
