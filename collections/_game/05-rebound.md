A physics based sport game where players cannot directly move but instead move via the recoil and collisions of fired projectiles. Each team attempts to manuever a ball into their opponents goal area. In addition to local play, I added support for networked physics. I also setup a lightweight build system to build a Unity on multiple platforms and publish to itch.io.
