A dynamically split screen camera for two player games. This involved the positioning of two cameras to align players in the appriate region of the frame and a shader to composite the two camera images into a single frame with the divider transition effect.

Implementation inspired by demo during a GDC talk by <a href="http://www.eiserloh.net/bio/" class="external-ref">Squirrel Eiserloh</a>.
