My partner and I participated in KenneyJam 2022, a 48 game making jam. I focused on coding while my partner worked on game design and art selection. Art assets by <a href="https://kenney.nl" class="external-ref">Kenney</a>.


I built the following systems in 48 hrs: player movement, projectiles, hit / hurt boxes and health, collectables, interactables, modal interactable for pickup & drop, spawn in / out transitions, status effect zones, wave based spawning, and a vine growth system.
