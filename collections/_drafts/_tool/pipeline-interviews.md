Brief philosophy:

How would you know if your interview process functions well?

Interrater reliability metrics, binomial trials

Could you get the same results with a completely random pipeline?

‌

V0 google sheets info

V1 fsharp play

V2 react + redux

V3 seriously, again? Fsharp play. Simplifying

‌

All have been toys. They do not achieve a goal

‌

Next try:

Take pipeline as an infile input. Structure, choice model and/or observed values

What is the chance that this result comes from the modeled pipeline?

What is the chance that this result comes from random selection?
